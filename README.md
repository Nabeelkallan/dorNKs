# dorNKs (dork_compiler)

## Google Dork Compilation Tool

A simple Python tool that generates Google dorks by combining company names with custom dorks.



### How to Use

1. **Prepare Files**  

   You will find two empty files in the project directory:(companies.txt, dorks.txt)
   - **companies.txt**: Add your company names or domains (one per line).
   - **dorks.txt**: Add your custom Google dorks (one per line).



2. **Run the Script**  

   Navigate to the folder where the script is located (cd dorNKs), 
   and run:  python dornks.py



3. **Output**  

   After running the code, you will find an output file:
   - **dorks.html**: Open this file manually, Select and execute the dorks.


### Troubleshooting  
If you encounter a "Permission denied" error, try running the script with elevated permissions using `sudo`.
